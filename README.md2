A Storm project experiment with VowPal wabbit and twitter streaming api

## Usage

Be sure to read up on Storm first:

http://storm-project.net/

https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki

This is my storm playground experimenting with Machine learning in Storm with VowPal wabbit.  The corpus used is the aclImdb corpus

To run on a local cluster:

```bash
lein run -m storm-ml-play.topology/run!
# OR
lein run -m storm-ml-play.topology/run! debug false workers 10
```

To run on a distributed cluster:

```bash
lein uberjar
# copy jar to nimbus, and then on nimbus:
bin/storm jar path/to/uberjar.jar storm-ml-play.TopologySubmitter workers 30 debug false
```

or use `[storm-deploy](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy/wiki)`
